                <p>The best question is an anwser.</p>
                <p>Listen to what people do, not just what they say.</p>
                <p>Less is more.</p>
                <p>Don't ever ruin an apology with an excuse.</p>
                <p>Small beats big.</p>
                <p>If it's not useful or entertaining, it's useless.</p>
                <p>Do the right thing even when no one is watching.</p>
