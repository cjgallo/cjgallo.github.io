      <description>04: Be honest Biggest learning this week is to be honest. If you&amp;rsquo;re anxious, admit it. Say it out loud. You&amp;rsquo;ll feel better. Just be yourself.

      <description>01: A Non-zero system Biggest learning this week was to develop a non-zero system. 1 &amp;gt; 0. Remember that.
Consuming Comment from reddit
This is maybe best reddit comment I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read. It comes from ryans01.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a summary of the 4 rules in my own words:
Rule 1: be consistent, one is better than zero. Do at least something that can help you toward your goal or dream each day.</description>

      <title>01: Fast and Curious</title>

      <description>01: Fast and Curious Fast and curious. I thought this would be a fun name for a blog or newsletter for some reason. It&amp;rsquo;s silly.
But also a good a way to try to explain what I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to accomplish with this exercise. The goal is to write down or publish what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to help me retain it and motivate me to keep learning new things.
It&amp;rsquo;s total stream of consciousness based off what I consumed and created during the past week or so.</description>
