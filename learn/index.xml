      <description>01: Fast and Curious Fast and curious. I thought this would be a fun name for a blog or newsletter for some reason. It&amp;rsquo;s silly.
But also a good a way to try to explain what I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to accomplish with this exercise. The goal is to write down or publish what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to help me retain it and motivate me to keep learning new things.
It&amp;rsquo;s total stream of consciousness based off what I consumed and created during the past week or so.</description>
