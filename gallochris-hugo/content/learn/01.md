# 01: Fast and Curious 

Fast and curious. I thought this would be a fun name for a blog or newsletter for some reason. It's silly.

But also a good a way to try to explain what I'm hoping to accomplish with this exercise. The goal is to *write down* or publish what I've learned to help me retain it and motivate me to keep learning new things. 

It's total stream of consciousness based off what I consumed and created during the past week or so. Here goes nothing. 

## Consuming

*Charlie Munger [book notes](https://www.allencheng.com/poor-charlies-almanack-charlie-munger-book-summary-pdf/)*

- Circle of Competence - know what you don't know, understand there is *chauffeur knowledge* 
- Be objective and selective
- Invert, and invert again. Do the opposite. Contrarian.  
- People are trying to be smar. All I am trying to do is not to be idiotic, but it’s harder than most people think. 
- Being a fanatic can help you persevere through a business, but it can also blind you to bad decisions. 

*[Tiny Desk: NPR Music](https://www.youtube.com/user/nprmusic)*

- Why does Tiny Desk work so well? It helps you discover new music.
- These are brilliant, a few I've watched over and over again
- [Daniel Caesar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBKa-AAy_vo)
- [Tom Misch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUMTaAQ43lY)
- [Thundercat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhVgbZdMdb0)
- [Erykah Badu](https://www.npr.org/2018/08/14/638483063/erykah-badu-tiny-desk-concert)

*Quote I'm thinking about* 

- Only bad things happen quickly. All the happiness-producing processes in our lives take time, usually a long time: learning new things, changing old behaviors, building satisfying relationships, raising children. This is why patience and determination are among life’s primary virtues. - Gordon Livington 


*Metaphor that made sense* 

- Their team always sort of looks like an unmade bed. - Michael Lombardi describing the Washington Redskins on a podcast.


## Creating

- Wrote a [blog on the circle of competence](https://blog.hotdogsandeggs.com/circle-of-competence/)
- Research on UNC freshmen basketball minutes played and games started
- Wrote an [article about those findings](https://fyi.dadgumboxscores.com/true-or-false-freshman/)
- Put together [update](https://fyi.dadgumboxscores.com/update-03/) about styles and design changes to dadgumboxscores.com  

*R Programming Language* 

- Signed up for [R for Journalism course](http://learn.r-journalism.com/)
- Helped some, lots or resources with examples, but get uninterested quickly 
- [Practical R blog post](https://thepracticalr.wordpress.com/2016/11/11/make-a-bar-plot-with-ggplot/) helped me make a graph in R for my article 

```
# make some data
season <-rep(c("2004", "2005", "2006", "2007", "2008", "2009", 
               "2010", "2011", "2012", "2013", "2014", "2015", "2016", "2017", "2018"), 2)
min <-c(4.3, 15.3, 45.3, 48.1, 2.5, 16.9, 29.2, 32.3, 18.9, 27.5, 22.2, 22.5, 3.8, 14.7, 20.4)
start <-c(0.7, 0.5, 48.4, 55.8, 0.0, 2.1, 10.3, 30.3, 2.6, 21.7, 19.4, 20.0, 0.0, 0.0, 9.2)
values <-c(min, start)
type <-c(rep("min", 15), rep("start", 15))
mydata <-data.frame(season, values)

library(ggplot2)
library(hrbrthemes)

p <-ggplot(mydata, aes(season, values))
p +geom_bar()

ggplot(mydata, aes(x=season,y = values)) +geom_bar(stat = "identity")

p + geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = type)) +
  labs(x="Season", y="Percentage",
       title="Freshman Class Minutes Played & Games Started",
       subtitle="Percentage of possible minutes played and games started since '03-04",
       caption="Brought to you by dadgumboxscores.com")  +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + 
  scale_fill_manual("Legend", values = c("min" = "#7BAFD4", "start" = "#13294B")) + 
  theme_ipsum()
``` 

- Want to learn more about animating graphs, spatial graphs, etc. 
- Try to write more and share graphs - chart of the day?

## Takeaways 

- Learning new things takes time. Only bad things happened really fast. 
- Take a breath. Breathe. Take another breath. 
- Try new things and share them. It'll make you better. Create stuff. 
- Keep learning, keep learning. 
- Slow down. Know what you don't know.
