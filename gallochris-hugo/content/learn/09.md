# 09: What You Care About 

Biggest takeaway this week was to practice the game of judgment. It helps you determine what you care about and what motivates you. 


## Consuming

*Dark Horse*

Finished [Dark Horse](https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Horse-Achieving-Success-Fulfillment/dp/0062683632) by Todd Rose and Ogi Ogas. 

An interesting book about there is a path to success for everyone. It's about getting better at what you care about most, and not trying to be the same as everyone else. 

A few notes: 

**Personalized success**: living a life of fulfillment *and* excellence. 

You achieve personalized success by harnessing your individuality in the pursuit of fulfillment to achieve excellence. 

**Standardization covenant** 

**Four elements of Dark Horse mindset** 

**1. Know your micro-motives**  

- our schools and jobs were never designed to help you figure out what whets your appetite 
- these institutions believe in universal motives, but one size doesn't fit all 
- use the *game of judgment to define your micro-motives* 

3 steps to the *game of judgment* 

a) become aware *when* you're judging someone/something
b) identify feelings, vivid reactions, when you're judging someone/something
c) ask *why* you are experiencing those feelings 

The *game of judgment* isn't about other people/things at all. It's about you. It's all about the details. The specifics. 

- motives can be contradictory - want to be around around people and be alone
- don't *follow your passion*
- **engineer your passion** 

**2. Know your choices**  

- be the same as everyone else, only better - that's not choosing, it's picking 
- picking is like using a menu at a restaurant 
- choosing is going to the grocery market and cooking dinner 
- choosing is an *active process* 
- picking is a *passive process* 

This is all about *fit* - the match between your individuality and your circumstances. 

The true power of choice is to find and select opportunities that activate the greatest number of your own micro-motives. 

- luck isn't a dark horse strategy 
- dark horses are ok with the worst-case scenario too
- what separates dark horses is *how they evaluate risk* 

Standardization mindset says risk is *determined by odds*.

Dark horse mindset says risk is *determined by fit*. 

Because if something is a good fit, the opportunity is low risk. If a poor fit, the opportunity is a high risk. 

Susan Rogers story - she took a job as a receptionist at a studio. The *odds* say an average person successfully going from receptionist at a studio to musical engineer are low. But Susan said there was a good fit between her motives, so it wasn't a high risk. 

A small difference in fit can lead to a large difference in fulfillment and excellence. 

**3. Know your strategies** 

- standardization says there is *one best way* 
- the truth is there are alternatives 
- knowing your strategies is a new way of thinking about the nature of your strengths 

Your micro-motives are part of your core identity, these are resistant to change. When we want something, we *feel* it. 

You know with confidence whether you want to go skydiving or eat a plate of eel sushi or watch the latest Marvel movie. 

Strengths are the opposite - inaccessible, contextual, and dynamic. Fuzzy. 

- everything you label as a strength is a artificial construct or ability 
- abilities like programming or performing ballet are done through effort, learning 

*How naturally gifted are you at riding a hippopotamus?* 

The only way to know is to try. You discern your strengths through action, not introspection. 

Contextual strengths: say you have trouble reading text

- that's a shortcoming if you want to be a literary critic
- if you want to be an astronomer, it might be an unexpected strength
- if you have trouble reading, your brain is better detecting images like black holes
- empathy is an asset for a nurse, and a shortcoming for a drone pilot 
- being tall is good for an NBA player, and bad for a coal miner 

Dynamic strengths: improve with practice, deteriorate through neglect

Your approach should be different when choosing a strategy than when choosing an opportunity. 

It's all about *trial and error* not staying the course or choosing the one best way. 

- you should expect failure
- it's necessary to develop excellence with strategies 
- it unearths your fuzzy strengths 

In summary, when you learn to know your micro-motives: 
- you engineer your own passion
- which endows you with energy and authenticity 

When you learn to know your choices: 
- you engineer your own purpose
- which provides you with meaning and direction 

And when you know your strategies: 
- you engineer your own achievement 
- which gives you a deep sense of pride and self-worth 

**4. Ignore the destination** 

- unlearn things
- destinations are catastrophic for fulfillment 

Standardized mindset: 

- standardized time (120 credit hours, MBA, certain degree) is to benefit institutions, not you 
- fixed dates makes it easier to assess people 
- this makes you believe that getting better is simply a matter of time 

Dark horse mindset: 

- time doesn't matter 
- the correct answer is it depends because time is relative 
- don't ask how long it takes to master something? 
- instead ask if this the *right strategy* for me to master something? 

Ignoring a destination is not the same as ignoring goals. A goal emerges out of your individuality. An active choice you have made. 

A destination is someone else's idea of an objective that you acceded to. It's always contingent. For example, getting into Harvard Law is a destination. 

A goal is winning your next debate club match, reading more philosophy books, and trying to get an internship. It's possible you will end up at Harvard Law. The self-knowledge you gain from these goals will open up new opportunities for you. 

**Gradient ascent**: it's like climbing to the highest peak. First, you start climbing in the direction of the steepest slop. Next, you pause and look around to gain a new vantage point to see if that's the right path to the peak. It's not fast. You repeat this until you reach the peak. 

**Get better at thing things you care about most.**

Second part of the book is all about how the world is tied to this standardization mindset. 

- talent isn't rare, there is a talent quota
- this makes us believe very few have the *potential* for excellence 
- standardization mindset selects talent 
- dark horse mindset is about developing talent
- a lottery system would be the only way to meet a quota and objectively evaluate candidates
- use a jagged profile to show that everyone has talent 
- quotas lead to a negative-sum game (you win, I lose, if I win, you lose)
- all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others 
- standardization qutoacracy, you don't need talent or hard work to climb the ladder, you need the right family or a fat wallet
- redefine equal opportunity as equal fit 
- dark horse mindset says your goal is not to become the best in the nation, but to become the best version of yourself 
- equal fit is about guaranteeing individual choice 
- ask if an institutions provides both personalization and individual choice? 
- choice without personalization is picking (food menu)
- Summit Public Schools example 
- Summit students have a dedicated mentor who meets with them one-on-one every week
- Summit uses a lottery system to accept students, everyone has an equal chance 
- Southern New Hampshire University started College for America, it eliminated grades and credit hours, replaced with competency-based evaluations 
- every student has a mentor helping them make the best educational choice 
- no formal instructors, only academic coaches and reviewers 
- greater freedom of choice comes greater personal accountability 

*Quote I like this week* 

You must not fool yourself - and you are the easiest person to fool. 

## Creating

Put together one of my first scatterplots using R, [shared here](https://twitter.com/dadgumboxscores/status/1060223455692574720). A lot more video work as well for Dadgum Box Scores. 

R code for the scatterplot: 

```
trip.data <- read.csv(file="trip.csv")
View(trip.data)

ggplot(data=trip.data, aes(x=PP, y=PA, label=Team)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_label_repel(aes(label = Team),
                   fontface = 'bold',
    			    box.padding = unit(0.50, "lines")
  		) +
	labs(x="3PT Percentage (%)", y="Percentage of shots from 3PT land (%)",
       title="Carolina Opponents: 3PT Attempt Rate Compared to 3PT Percentage Since Start of '17-18 Season",
       subtitle="Up & to the right means a high percentage of shots were from 3PT land and a high percentage went in, up & to the left means high 3PT attempt rate and low 3PT percentage.",
       caption="Brought to you by the letter dadgumboxscores.com") + 
   theme_ipsum()
```
