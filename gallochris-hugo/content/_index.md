### Make Things & Share What You Learn

I enjoy trying to make things with computers, and I've learned how to build my own static websites. 

When I couldn't find old UNC basketball box scores, I built [dadgumboxscores.com](http://dadgumboxscores.com/) to solve it. 

Out of frustration to learn advanced college basketball statistics, I put together documentation, [cbbstatshelp.com](https://cbbstatshelp.com/), to make it easier for others. 

It's important to share what you learn, and I try to do so on [my blog](https://blog.hotdogsandeggs.com) and other places on the web.

Learning from others is powerful too, and every so often, I transcribe interesting interviews and talks. I call it [What They Said](https://people.hotdogsandeggs.com/). One of my favorites is this transcription of [Manoj Bhargavaâ€™s](https://people.hotdogsandeggs.com/manoj-bhargava/) talk.
