I'm Chris Gallo.
================

And this is [hot dogs and eggs](/manifesto). It's my little piece of the
world wide web. A place for me to {{< yellow "stay curious." >}}

I spend my days working with six lovely people at
[Highrise](https://highrisehq.com). We make software to help you keep
track of who you talk to, so you're prepared to do business. My job is
to make the people that use Highrise [feel
important](https://blog.hotdogsandeggs.com/listen-to-what-people-do/).

### Make Things and Share What You Learn

I enjoy trying to make things with computers, and I've learned how to build my own static websites. 

When I couldn't find old UNC basketball box scores, I built [dadgumboxscores.com](http://dadgumboxscores.com/) to solve it. 

Out of frustration to learn advanced college basketball statistics, I put together documentation, [cbbstatshelp.com](https://cbbstatshelp.com/), to make it easier for others. 

It's important to share what you learn, and I try to do so on [my blog](https://blog.hotdogsandeggs.com) and other places on the web like [Signal v.
Noise](https://m.signalvnoise.com/why-you-should-care-less-7ee81c20240a#.v2mrkrbb8).

Learning from others is powerful too, and every so often, I transcribe interesting interviews and talks. I call it [What They Said](https://people.hotdogsandeggs.com/). One of my favorites is this transcription of [Manoj Bhargavaâ€™s](https://people.hotdogsandeggs.com/manoj-bhargava/) talk.
