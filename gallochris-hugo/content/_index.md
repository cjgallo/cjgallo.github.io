# Hi, I'm Chris.

And this is [hot dogs and eggs](/manifesto). It's my little piece of the
world wide web. A place for me to stay curious.

**How do I stay curious?**

- writing to think ‚û°Ô∏è [blog](https://blog.hotdogsandeggs.com)
- reading to understand ‚û°Ô∏è [books](https://books.hotdogsandeggs.com)

**What do I do?**

I run customer operations for software products from my home in Charlotte, North Carolina. My skills include email support, quality assurance, documentation, and technical tasks (Ruby üíé and R üìâ). 

Today, I work with [{{< zipline "Zipline." >}}](https://www.retailzipline.com/) Our team makes it easier for retailers to communicate with each other. 

If you want to learn more about my background in customer support, Rob Williams was kind enough to have me on his Freelance podcast. [Listen to it here](https://twitter.com/YoFolyo/status/1196127933384908800?s=20). 

**What am I up to as of late?** 

I'm starting to learn more about how to use R. In the past, I've built a Shiny application, [app.dadgumboxscores.com](https://app.dadgumboxscores.com/), with every UNC men's basketball box score since 2003-04 season. 

My next project is called [fungo](https://fungo.hotdogsandeggs.com). It's a place for me to play with data and share what I learn.
