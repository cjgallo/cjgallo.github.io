# Hi, I'm Chris.

And this is [hot dogs and eggs](/manifesto). It's my little piece of the
world wide web. It's a place for me to stay curious.

**How do I stay curious?**

- writing to think on [my blog](https://blog.hotdogsandeggs.com)
- sharing what I'm consuming, creating, and [learning](/learn/)
- transcribing interesting interviews or talks of [what they said](https://people.hotdogsandeggs.com/)

**What do I do?**

I run customer operations for software products from my home in Charlotte, North Carolina. My skills include email/phone support, quality assurance, documentation development, product management, and general communication. 

Today, I work at [Emburse](https://www.emburse.com/), where we help people manage business expenses. 

**What else?**

I'm interested in *how* sports work, so I combine that interest with trying to make Internet things with computers and build my own static websites or tools.

- [cbbstatshelp.com](https://cbbstatshelp.com/) - documentation to explain advanced basketball statistics
