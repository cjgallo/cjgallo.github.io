# Hi, I'm Chris.

And this is [hot dogs and eggs](/manifesto). It's my little piece of the
world wide web. It's a place for me to stay curious.

**How do I stay curious?**

- writing to think ➡️ [blog](https://blog.hotdogsandeggs.com)
- reading to understand ➡️ [books](https://books.hotdogsandeggs.com)

**What do I do?**

I run customer operations for software products from my home in Charlotte, North Carolina. My skills include email/phone support, quality assurance, documentation development, technical tasks, and general communication. 

Today, I work with [{{< zipline "Zipline." >}}](https://www.retailzipline.com/) Our team makes it easier for retailers to communicate with each other. 

**What am I interested in now?**

I'm interested in *how* sports work, so I combine that interest with trying to make Internet things with computers and build my own static websites or tools. 

My current pet project is [dadgumboxscores.com](http://dadgumboxscores.com/). It's a collection of data using every Carolina box score since '03-04. And I also share charts/video [@dadgumboxscores](https://twitter.com/dadgumboxscores).
