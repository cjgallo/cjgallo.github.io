I'm Chris Gallo.
================

And this is [hot dogs and eggs](/manifesto). It's my little piece of the
world wide web. A place for me to {{< yellow "stay curious." >}}

I spend my days working with six lovely people at
[Highrise](https://highrisehq.com). We make software to help you keep
track of who you talk to, so you're prepared to do business. My job is
to make the people that use Highrise [feel
important](https://blog.hotdogsandeggs.com/listen-to-what-people-do/).

### Writing

I share what I learn on [my blog](https://blog.hotdogsandeggs.com). My
writing has been published in other places on the web like [Signal v.
Noise](https://m.signalvnoise.com/why-you-should-care-less-7ee81c20240a#.v2mrkrbb8)
and [The Secondary
Break](http://www.thesecondarybreak.us/carolinas-frequent-fouler/).

### Projects

Every so often, I transcribe interesting interviews and talks. I call it
**[What They Said](https://people.hotdogsandeggs.com/)**. It's one of
the ways I learn from people I admire, and it's a [helpful
resource](https://twitter.com/gbenedict/status/611158815715622912) for
others too. One of my favorites is this transcription of [Manoj
Bhargava's](http://people.hotdogsandeggs.com/manoj-bhargava) talk.

I also love to try to make things with computers too. Here are a few
other static sites I've put together.

-   [cbbstatshelp.com](https://cbbstatshelp.com/): learn about advanced
    analytics for college basketball.
-   [dadgumboxscores.com](http://dadgumboxscores.com/): find any UNC
    men's basketball box score since 2003-2004.
-   [dalecarnegieismyhomeboy.com](https://hotdogsandeggs.com/dale): all
    30 principles from *How to Win Friends and Influence People*
