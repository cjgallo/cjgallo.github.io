Hi, I'm Chris.
================

And this is [hot dogs and eggs](/manifesto). It's my little piece of the
world wide web. A place for me to {{< yellow "stay curious." >}}

## About me

I run customer operations for software products from my home in Charlotte, North Carolina. My skills include email/phone support, quality assurance, documentation development, product management, and general communication. 

I enjoy working on tough problems with small teams. My approach to customer operations is to keep product development, sales, and support all in sync because customers deserve an experience that leaves them feeling important. 

Today, I work at [Emburse](https://www.emburse.com/), where we help people manage business expenses.

## Making Things 

I enjoy trying to make things with computers and build my own static websites or tools. 

When I couldn't find old UNC basketball box scores, I built [dadgumboxscores.com](http://dadgumboxscores.com/) to solve it. 

Out of frustration to learn advanced college basketball statistics, I put together documentation, [cbbstatshelp.com](https://cbbstatshelp.com/), to make it easier for others. 

I share [what I learn here](/learn/). You can find my writing on [my blog](https://blog.hotdogsandeggs.com) and [other places](https://m.signalvnoise.com/why-you-should-care-less-7ee81c20240a) on the web.

Every so often, I transcribe interesting interviews and talks. It's a bit weird. I call it [What They Said](https://people.hotdogsandeggs.com/). One of my favorites is this transcription of [Manoj Bhargavaâ€™s](https://people.hotdogsandeggs.com/manoj-bhargava/) talk.
