HOW MY BOSS DESCRIBES ME
----------

* * * * *

> I hired Chris because he was already doing support for me at Draft for free and I hadn’t even asked him to :) He’s incredibly ambitious and helpful in every aspect of your business, way beyond typical support. He’ll run your business if you want him to. I promise you, customers will write in to you about how much they love Chris.

HOW I DESCRIBE ME
----------

* * * * *

I've run customer operations for software products from my home in Charlotte, North Carolina for five plus years. My skills include email/phone support, quality assurance, documentation development, product management, and general communication. 

My approach to customer operations is to keep product development, sales, and support all in sync because customers deserve an experience that leaves them feeling important. 

Three principles that help me do that:

1.  [Listen to what people
    do](http://blog.hotdogsandeggs.com/listen-to-what-people-do/), and
    not just what they say.
2.  Ask questions because the [best answer is often a
    question](http://supportops.co/dont-be-a-robot-create-conversations/).
3.  Suggest [workarounds](http://blog.hotdogsandeggs.com/workarounds/).
    We're all better when we're resourceful.
