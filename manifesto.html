                <h2>What's in a name?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Most people claim their own name as a domain. My namesakes at Ernest and Julio Gallo Winery have commandeered domains that include the word "gallo" in them.</p>

                <p>So when I started this site a few years ago, I was stumped
                on a domain name. And then I heard my grandma talking about
                making hot dogs and eggs for me as a kid. I kept saying it all
                day. Hot dogs and eggs. It made me smile :)</p>

                <p>I bought the domain name and laughed. But it stuck. It's
                goofy and different, just like me. A curious combination, hot
                dogs and eggs.</p>
                <p>The name has come to mean much more to me. It's part of my philosophy. And it represents what I believe.</p>

                <p>The best question is an anwser.</p>
                <p>Listen to what people do, not just what they say.</p>
                <p>Less is more.</p>
                <p>Simple doesn't mean easy.</p>
                <p>Trust is built by giving it first.</p>
                <p>Don't ever ruin an apology with an excuse.</p>
                <p>Small beats big.</p>
                <p>If it's not useful or entertaining, it's useless.</p>
                <p>Do the right thing even when no one is watching.</p>
