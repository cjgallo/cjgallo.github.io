                <h1>What's with the name hot dogs and eggs?</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>Most people claim their own name as a domain (chrisgallo.com). But my namesakes at Ernest and Julio Gallo Winery have commandeered domains that include the word "gallo" in them.</p>

                <p>So when I started this site in 2014, I was stumped
                on a domain name. And then I heard my grandma talking about
                making hot dogs and eggs for me as a kid. I kept saying it all
                day. Hot dogs and eggs. It made me smile :)</p>

                <p>I bought the domain name and laughed. But it stuck. It's
                goofy and different, just like me. A curious combination, hot
                dogs and eggs.</p>

                <p>The name has come to mean much more to me. It's part of my philosophy. And it represents what I <a href="/content.html">believe</a>.</p>
