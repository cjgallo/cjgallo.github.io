Hot Dogs and Eggs
========================

A curious combination of beliefs, hot dogs and eggs is a simple recipe. Listen. Ask Questions. Do Less. Be human. 

Inside this site you'll find an appetite for these beliefs everywhere you look - blog posts, influences, and projects.

This website was built by Chris Gallo with the help of the internet.

For a beginner, coding is difficult. But when you figure something out it is incredibly rewarding. I tested different ideas using [Codepen](http://codepen.io/cjgallo/), and read countless articles on [CSS Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/). Thanks to my friend [James Jackson](https://twitter.com/thejacksonjd) for the advice. 

I transitioned [my blog](http://hotdogsandeggs.com) to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) using [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) built by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo). I write, edit, and revise posts using [Draft](https://draftin.com/) by [Nathan Kontny](https://twitter.com/natekontny).

Thanks for stopping by and enjoy your stay. 

Cheers
