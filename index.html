<h1>I'm Chris Gallo.</h1> 
<br>
<p>And this is <a href="/manifesto" >hot dogs and eggs</a>. It's my little piece of the world wide web. A place for me to stay curious.</p>

<p>I spend my days working with 7 lovely people at <a href="https://highrisehq.com" >Highrise</a>. We make software that helps you track who you talk to, so that you're prepared to do business. My job is to make the people that use Highrise <a href="http://blog.hotdogsandeggs.com/listen-to-what-people-do/" >feel important</a>.</p>

<p>I write to think on <a href="https://blog.hotdogsandeggs.com" >my blog</a>. My writing is published in other places on the web like <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/why-you-should-care-less-7ee81c20240a#.v2mrkrbb8">Signal v. Noise</a> and <a href="http://www.thesecondarybreak.us/carolinas-frequent-fouler/" >The Secondary Break</a> (I'm a big <span style="color: #56a0d3; font-weight: bold;">UNC basketball</span> fan).</p>

<p>Every so often, I transcribe interesting interviews and talks. It helps me share what I learn from people I admire, and it's a <a href="https://twitter.com/gbenedict/status/611158815715622912" >great resource</a> for others too. Two of my favorites are <a href="http://people.hotdogsandeggs.com/manoj-bhargava">Manoj Bhargava</a> and <a href="http://people.hotdogsandeggs.com/julie-zhuo">Julie Zhuo</a>.</p>

<p>I love to try to make things with computers too. Here are a few static sites I've put together.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cbbstatshelp.com/">cbbstatshelp.com</a>: learn about advanced analytics for college basketball.</li>
<li><a href="http://dadgumboxscores.com/">dadgumboxscores.com</a>: find any UNC men's basketball box score since 2003-2004.</li>
<li><a href="http://dalecarnegieismyhomeboy.com/">dalecarnegieismyhomeboy.com</a>: all 30 principles from <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em></li>
</ul>
