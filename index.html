<h1>I'm Chris Gallo.</h1> 
<p>And this is <a href="/manifesto" >hot dogs and eggs</a>. It's my little piece of the world wide web. A place for me to <span style="background-color: #faf785; padding: 1px 2px;"> stay curious</span>.</p>

<p>I spend my days working with six lovely people at <a href="https://highrisehq.com" >Highrise</a>. We make software to help you keep track of who you talk to, so you're prepared to do business. My job is to make the people that use Highrise <a href="http://blog.hotdogsandeggs.com/listen-to-what-people-do/" >feel important</a>.</p>

<h3>Writing</h3>
<p>I share what I learn on <a href="https://blog.hotdogsandeggs.com" >my blog</a>. My writing has been published in other places on the web like <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/why-you-should-care-less-7ee81c20240a#.v2mrkrbb8">Signal v. Noise</a> and <a href="http://www.thesecondarybreak.us/carolinas-frequent-fouler/" >The Secondary Break</a>.</p>

<h3>Projects</h3>
<p>Every so often, I transcribe interesting interviews and talks. I call it <b><a href="https://people.hotdogsandeggs.com/" >What They Said</a></b>. It's one of the ways I learn from people I admire, and it's a <a href="https://twitter.com/gbenedict/status/611158815715622912" >helpful resource</a> for others too. One of my favorites is this transcription of <a href="http://people.hotdogsandeggs.com/manoj-bhargava">Manoj Bhargava's</a> talk.</p>

<p>I also love to try to make things with computers too. Here are a few other static sites I've put together.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cbbstatshelp.com/">cbbstatshelp.com</a>: learn about advanced analytics for college basketball.</li>
<li><a href="http://dadgumboxscores.com/">dadgumboxscores.com</a>: find any UNC men's basketball box score since 2003-2004.</li>
<li><a href="http://dalecarnegieismyhomeboy.com/">dalecarnegieismyhomeboy.com</a>: all 30 principles from <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em></li>
</ul>
