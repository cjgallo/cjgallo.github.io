                <hr>

                <p>And this is my website. I call it <b>hot dogs and eggs</b>.</p>

                <p>I spend my days supporting customers at <a href=
                "http://highrisehq.com" target="_blank">Highrise</a>. We're a
                small software company that helps people keep track of who they
                talk to, what they talk about, and when to follow up.</p>

                <p>Here's a few things I believe:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The best answer is a question.</li>

                    <li>Listen to what people do, not just what they say.</li>

                    <li>Support your product like a customer, become a
                    user.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>And a few things I do day-to-day:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Communicate directly with customers</li>

                    <li>Share ways to improve the product</li>

                    <li>Write help documentation</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I work remotely and reside in Charlotte, NC.
                And here's more about what you'll find here.</p>

                <h2>Side projects</h2>
    

                <p>Here are a couple side
                projects that I have fun with.</p>

                <p style="text-decoration: underline; text-transform: uppercase;"><a href="http://people.hotdogsandeggs.com/">Transcribed
                Advice from real people</a></p>

                <p>Many moons ago I was a sports information director. A fancy
                way of saying I helped cover the athletic teams at my alma
                mater, UNC. One of my tasks was to transcribe quotes to help
                reporters meet deadlines. I hated transcribing audio at the
                time, but somehow miss it today :)</p>

                <p>Now I irregularly transcribe talks and interviews I find
                interesting across the web. It's a strange project, but I love
                it. Here's one of <a href=
                "http://people.hotdogsandeggs.com/allan-branch/">my
                favorite transcriptions</a>.</p>

                <p style="text-decoration: underline; text-transform: uppercase;"><a href=
                "http://dalecarnegieismyhomeboy.com/">Dale Carnegie is My
                Homeboy</a></p>

                <p>If I could only recommend one book to you, it would be
                <a href=
                "http://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/1508569754">
                How to Win Friends and Influence People</a> by Dale Carnegie.
                Millions have read it for a reason. The principles are
                timeless.</p>

                <p>Reload the page to see all 30 principles from the book one
                at a time. The project is to remind all of us to be
                considerate.</p>

                <h2>Wait, what's with hot dogs and eggs?</h2>

                <p>I'm sure you're wondering about the name of this website.
                Most people claim their own name as a domain. My namesakes at Ernest and Julio Gallo Winery have
                commandeered domains that include the word "gallo" in them.</p>

                <p>So when I started this site a few years ago, I was stumped
                on a domain name. And then I heard my grandma talking about
                making hot dogs and eggs for me as a kid. I kept saying it all
                day. Hot dogs and eggs. It made me smile.</p>

                <p>I bought the domain name and laughed. But it stuck. It's
                goofy and different, just like me. A curious combination, hot
                dogs and eggs.</p><a id="contact"></a>
