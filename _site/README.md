Hot Dogs and Eggs
========================

This is the source for my personal website, [hotdogsandeggs.com](http://hotdogsandeggs.com). 

It's built with the help of the Internet. It uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and it's hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

There are 2 subdomains, [blog.hotdogsandeggs.com]((http://blog.hotdogsandeggs.com) and [people.hotdogsandeggs.com]((http://people.hotdogsandeggs.com), that live in separate repos. 

A lot of the code written here is all an experiment. It was first built in 2014, and I know far more today than I did back then. There are more than a few examples that might not be the most efficient way to do things. Please keep in mind that this site is a playground for me to learn more about how to code and build a website. 

I've used what I've learned here on a couple side projects: 

### Dale Carnegie is My Homeboy

If I could recommend one book to you, it would be [How to Win Friends and Influence People](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People) by Dale Carnegie. Ignore the chessy title. Embrace the principles and learn to be considerate.

See the site here: [dalecarnegieismyhomeboy.com](http://dalecarnegieismyhomeboy.com)

The site was inspired by [tomhaverfoods.com](http://tomhaverfoods.com). Reload the page to see all 30 principles from the book one at a time. 


### College Basektball Stats Help

I'm a former sports information director, and love stats and sports. I built this site to help others find out more about college basketball advanced analytics. 

Check out the purpose and site here: [cbbstatshelp.com](http://cbbstatshelp.com)

It's built using [Jekyll Collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/) and hosted on [S3](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html).
