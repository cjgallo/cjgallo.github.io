<p>It&rsquo;s my job to make customers feel important. Three principles that help
me do that:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://blog.hotdogsandeggs.com/listen-to-what-people-do/">Listen to what people
do</a>, and
not just what they say.</li>
<li>Ask questions because the <a href="http://supportops.co/dont-be-a-robot-create-conversations/">best answer is often a
question</a>.</li>
<li>Suggest <a href="http://blog.hotdogsandeggs.com/workarounds/">workarounds</a>.
We&rsquo;re all better when we&rsquo;re resourceful.</li>
</ol>
